# z4lab-surftimer-release
compiled files for our private community timer


This repo is meant for our compiled SurfTimer. 
This timer is specially created for our community (so it wouldn't make sense to provide the source files in the first place) and it's mainly focused on server performance and the well-being of the players on it. **I WON'T provide support or help of any kind! If you still want to use our timer maybe try to use our public one**. => https://github.com/z4lab/z4lab-surftimer. 
You can find installation instructions over there. These also apply to this repo (but I can't ensure this 100%).
