# z4lab-surftimer-release
compiled files for our private community timer

The z4lab community, as of April 25, 2021, no longer provides public game servers. This includes support for all software and services created or maintained by our team members. Under some exceptions, support may still be provided, but this is not expected in any view. It should also be noted that all software and services provided by us may no longer be functional. All provided softwares or services were created for and in the sense exactly for our community and fulfilled our purpose. 
Thank you for your understanding ~ ace

This repo is meant for our compiled SurfTimer. 
This timer is specially created for our community (so it wouldn't make sense to provide the source files in the first place) and it's mainly focused on server performance and the well-being of the players on it. **I WON'T provide support or help of any kind! If you still want to use our timer maybe try to use our public one**. => https://github.com/z4lab/z4lab-surftimer. 
You can find installation instructions over there. These also apply to this repo (but I can't ensure this 100%).
